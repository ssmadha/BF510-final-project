# BF510-final-project

This repository is the submission for the final project for BF510 [Institutional Racism in Health and Science](http://irhs.bu.edu/) for Shariq Madha.

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks showcasing how the GPT-2 Natural Language Processing was fine-tuned on scientific research articles, as well as the necessary files to run the notebooks. Please find the model, as well as an interface to generate text from it, [here](https://huggingface.co/ssmadha/gpt2-finetuned-scientific-articles).

## Background
The model that is being finetuned is the GPT-2 Natural Language Processing (NLP) model. NLP is a way for computers to try and interpret human language. A type of NLP that goes beyond this in an attempt to have a computer generate its own language is Text Generation of Casual Language Modeling (CLM). GPT-2 is a popular model used for this type of NLP and has been trained on outbound links from Reddit posts that recieved at least 3 'karma', except for those leading to Wikipedia. It has been shown that there is bias in the algorithm, as seen in this [tweet](https://twitter.com/TomerUllman/status/1101485289720242177). There are techniques for dealing with this kind of bias and one of the most significant ways of doing so is to ensure a good input dataset. There are additional methods for mitigating this kind of bias, especially during the training and testing phase, however due to technical limitations, these were not pursued in this study. A good example of this used in training an NLP model is explored by Mozafari et al. (2020).

## Rationale
The goal of this project is to showcase correcting for algorithmic bias, specifically with the use of training. The CLM was used to showcase this since it is a good way to showcase a models "opinions" on sensitive topics such as race. As GPT-2 was already an algorithm that showed unintended bias, as stated above, though it had the possibility of being fine-tuned on additional data. A dataset of scientific articles was used for this purpose. These were chosen as, by definition, they should be unbiased and provide

## Methodology
Pubmed Central was queried for algorithmic bias, as that is the focus of this study. So as to better fit to the nature of natural language, the whole article is not considered. To clean the data, only the abstracts, introduction, results, discussion, and conclusion sections of articles are included, and only the text, no headers. 

## Results
With an average training loss of about 2.50 and a validation loss of about 2.38, the performance of the training was on par with examples given on the Hugging Face website, indicating the training was successful. Below, please find the text generation results of a few prompts that were given to the existing GPT-2 model as well as the GPT-2 model fine-tuned on scientific articles (SAG). As the text generation results are different every time, of note, these were only run once, on each, with the first results shown below. While some of the text are awkwardly worded or uncomprehensible (always a risk with text generation), subjectively, as expected, the SAG model seemed to showcased a more scientifically-based "opinion" on race and bias. For example, when given the prompt "The concept that race is biological is", GPT-2 stated "Racism is intrinsic to biology: A race is a natural phenomenon", while SAG stated "But to the great majority of scientists there is no such thing as a biologically-based view". 

Prompt: Racial bias is 
GPT-2 generated text:
Racial bias is the systematic discrimination of biological material using a method which avoids the need to define characteristics. This is because only biological material which is not available from other biological resources, and therefore can not be used by others, is considered. This principle can be applied to many kinds of biological resources, from biological materials which can be synthesised through industrial processes to biological materials which are not biological materials. Biochemical resources can be used by other biological resources too as well; the biological material which is produced can be compared between these bioresources.However, some methodological concerns arise in interpreting the reference materials’s identification and classification, e.g. when comparing different biological resources (e.g. the biological materials obtained during the manufacturing process).The literature on classification is primarily concerned with biological material quality, ie, whether it satisfies the physical, mechanical, and chemical properties and whether it is suitable for biological systems or otherwise. Biochemical resources can and have already been classified by different methods to varying degrees. For example, in the assessment of high fidelity biological materials, the criterion is that the biological materials are suitable for a diverse number of applications. This process has been used in many laboratories, especially as an independent assessment tool.The classification system

Racial bias is a commonly accepted explanation of discrimination and exploitation of minorities, the most recent studies showing that, despite the considerable gains that have been made for many countries, the majority of minorities are still disproportionately affected in their ethnic background. Indeed, despite the efforts to tackle the phenomenon by focusing on the socio-economic and socio-cultural mechanisms that account for the discrimination, this paper has focused on the socioeconomic and political contexts for the discrimination. This provides a framework for understanding the effect of prejudice in different countries, to better understand the mechanisms that lead to these disparities and to provide a framework for investigating the effects of social disparities on racial prejudice. These studies aimed to understand the economic and political impacts of discrimination, and how these social barriers and socio-economic barriers can play a role in disparities in the study of racial prejudice (Vernan, 2007). The purpose of the paper is to identify the impact of discrimination in different countries on different levels of socioeconomic and political diversity in the population and to explore ways in which social inequalities can impact minority representation and exploitation in other fields.<|endoftext|>

The concept that race is biological is inclusive (Schnorova, 1996; Hebert and Vellar, 2004; Vellar et al., 2015; Hebert et al., 2015; Kluger et al., 2016; Oster and Thaddeus, 2015). Race is not a natural phenomenon. Racism is intrinsic to biology: A race is a natural phenomenon when the genetic diversity of a population is maximally high (Hebert, 1998). Racism is biologically significant in terms of several biological processes: It can be a biological consequence of structural genetic variation and functional variants (Gautier et al., 2014; Hebert et al., 2015; Hebert et al., 2015; Hebert et al., 2014; Hebert et al., 2014), as well as a social consequence of a heterogeneous population that, when applied in conjunction with a social order, will also lead to increased inequality in the social situation (Nguyen et al., 2012). Race plays an important role in biological processes: Race (and especially ethnicity) play roles in the structure of social structures (Hebert et al., 2015; Hebert et al., 2015; Hebert et al., 2015; Hebert et al., 2014

The concept that race is biological is often dismissed as a problem of bias  on the part of men. But to the great majority of scientists there is no such thing as a biologically-based view, and white-female differences in differences in associations between groups can be traced back to race (cf. McClatchy 1993, 2010). In fact, many aspects of intelligence evolve in societies which relating to genetic drift are perversely disordered. In short, the assumption is that race is an independent part of human biology. When the relevance of race to our society is challenged, it is often assumed that race is inversely disordered. However, it is clear that the nature and magnitude of these differences are not consistent with those implications. Race can be explained by a variation in individual cognitive abilities or by traits that make a different associate with race. In this study we sought to address both of these questions by constructing a set of computational data and applying the concept of race

Prompt: Algorithmic bias comes from 
GPT-2 generated text:
Algorithmic bias comes from a systematic bias’s use of data’s performance to evaluate its effectiveness in decision-making. The systematic bias in an  expert’s decision regarding the “use of “data’ is not only one of the most frequently encountered pitfalls of statistical analysis, it is also a major driver for the un-statistics that researchers develop when they use their data in analytical disciplines like assessments in intelligence.The research agenda often shifts from systematic (i.e., bias and uncertainty) toward discursive (i.e., bias-focused) (see Figure 2). Some expert experts have discussed a more bias-focused analytical system approach (see Bias Theory, Bias Research: Toward an Expert-Conference Working Group, The Bias Research Emerging From the Academic Conference, The Bias Research: Toward an Expert-Conference Working Group, The Bias Research: Toward an Expert

Algorithmic bias comes from a belief that we can predict the correct dysfunction and regard the correct dysfunction on a random map from our inputs which we then need to select the correct dysfunction and regard the correct dysfunction on this map. The Dysfunction  function is so important or important that  its “prediction” is not the best measure of the dysfunction’ but is the same as “being accurate on the correct dysfunction ”(or “being accurate on the correct dysfunction ”(or “being accurate on the correct dysfunction ”(or [ ])) ”. As in “dysfunction”, (the dysfunction is the “random map” of data). The Dysfunction  function has two parameter: its  value  and “pred
